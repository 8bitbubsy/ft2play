# ft2play
Bit-accurate C port of FT2.09's XM replayer (SB16/WAV render mode) \
<i>NOTE: This is not the exact same replayer/mixer code used in the FT2 clone!</i> \
\
It contains an example program in the ft2play folder for how to interface with the API. \
This has not been tested on other platforms than Windows, but it <i>should</i> compile on Linux and macOS!
